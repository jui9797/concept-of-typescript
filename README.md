# TypeScript Mastery Repository

Welcome to the **TypeScript Mastery Repository**!  
This repository is designed to help you learn **TypeScript** — from the basics to advanced concepts, and finally mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in TypeScript.

---

## Module 1: Basic Data Types & Fundamentals

This module introduces you to the **core features** and **syntax** of TypeScript.  
It covers all the building blocks you need to start writing clean and type-safe code.

### Topics Covered

- **Basic Data Types** – number, string, boolean, array, tuple, enum
- **Objects** – defining and typing objects
- **Optionals** – handling optional properties in types
- **Literal Types** – creating exact value types
- **Functions** – defining typed functions and return types
- **Spread & Rest Operators** – combining and splitting data
- **Destructuring** – extracting values efficiently
- **Type Alias** – creating reusable custom types
- **Union & Intersection Types** – combining multiple types
- **Ternary Operator** – conditional expressions
- **Never & Unknown Types** – handling unreachable and unknown values

---

## Module 2: Advanced TypeScript Concepts

This module focuses on **advanced TypeScript topics** to help you write more robust, flexible, and scalable code.

### Topics Covered

- **Type Assertion** – telling the compiler what type you expect
- **Intersection Types** – combining multiple types into one
- **Type vs Interface** – differences and use cases
- **Generics** – writing reusable components and functions
- **Generic with Interface** – creating flexible type-safe interfaces
- **Function with Generic** – applying generics to functions
- **Constraints** – restricting generic types
- **Asynchronous TypeScript** – working with async/await and Promises
- **Conditional Types** – using `extends` to build dynamic types
- **Mapped Types** – transforming existing types into new forms
- **Utility Types** – built-in helpers like `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Readonly`, etc.

---

## Module 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript

This module teaches how to implement OOP principles in TypeScript effectively using **classes, inheritance, and encapsulation**.

### Topics Covered

- **Class & Object** – creating classes and instances
- **Inheritance in OOP** – extending and reusing functionality
- **Type Guards using `typeof` and `in`** – narrowing types safely
- **Type Guards using `instanceof`** – runtime type checking
- **Access Modifiers** – `public`, `private`, `protected` for data protection
- **Getter & Setter** – accessing and mutating private data safely
- **Static Members** – class-level properties and methods
- **Polymorphism** – using the same interface for different data types
- **Abstraction in TypeScript** – hiding implementation details
- **Encapsulation** – bundling data and methods together
